# DeAudit - A decentralized Audit Marketplace on Polygon

Owing to the immutable nature of blockchain technology, it is impossible to update the code after its deployment. Placing smart contracts without adequate audits could lead to undesirable situations like differences in the contract's intended performance, gas leakage, and more.

- 47% of the web3 hacks in the first half of 2022 were due to contract vulnerabilities.
- Only 52% of the exploited web3 projects were audited.
- Helps earn users/investors' trust for the product and the idea.

Auditing isn't an easy process. Auditing wait times on top audit firms are 9-12 months and are expensive. We need something that is more participative and allows for new and yet-unproven security auditors. This is the motivation behind building DeAudit, a decentralized audit marketplace that turns the auditing process into a prediction marketplace.
